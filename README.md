# gorr-language
A toy specification language designed for my high school's senior capstone project.

Researched and written from January to June 2023. Was one of ~20
people in my ~120-person class to be awarded distincition—basically honors—for my work.

* [Presentation](presentation/index.pdf)
	* I heavily regret not recording this, as I think it was the best
	presentaiton I've ever done. The full ODP presentation with speaker notes
	can be found in [`presentation/`](https://github.com/SuperSonicHub1/gorr-language/tree/master/presentation).
* [Portfolio](portfolio/index.html)
	* Proof to my advisor that I actually did something during the
	class. Contains a draft version of my specification
	and an abridged list of the ~10 papers I read for research.
* [Specification](spec/index.html)
	* The informal specification for Gorr, the language I created
	to demonstrate my ideas. It served its purpose during the 
	presentation, but I would likely start from scratch if I write my own
	speclang as its a little too imperative in some places and also
	has some awkward underspecified operator precedence issues.
	Still very proud of the fact that I was able to parse English
	using EBNF; I love the idea of using restricted forms of language
	to do computation.
